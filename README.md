ARP spoofing attack in rust

First time playing with rust, not meant for actual use.

Made in Clion using [libpnet](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet) <br>
PoC from https://gist.github.com/apsun/4ddc09f40c0c65191b8cdee1e09ba70f

Tried using libpnet functions where possible, but it has a few issues with Windows. 
Taped up with powershell and had to remove reading packets.
